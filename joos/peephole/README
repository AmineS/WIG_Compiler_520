The primary functionality was programmed in limitCODE. The code loops through all the CODE elements in the linked list. They pass it to stack effect. The value of inc from stack effect is stored in stack exchange. This difference is stored in a stack_limit variable. If the stack_limit exceeds the max_stack_limit variable then the value of the latter is replaced with the former. 
In the case we have if/else branches in the code. limitCODE detects this andpasses this functionality to a branch function. The branch function traverses all the branches calculating their stack limits. The largest stack_limit for a branch is returned. All visited CODE nodes are marked as visited thus limitCODE does not traverse anything twice.
