Testing:

How to test?
	go in Makefile's directory and do a "make test"

Test Cases:
	test cases are in stacklimits/testing/test_cases

How is testing done?
	The python script runTests.py runs the joosa+ compiler on the test_cases and stores the .j's
	in a folder. Then it runs our joos compiler on the test_cases and stores the .j's in another
	folder. Then it reads the stack limits and prints a table illustrating the comparison.
	Before exiting, the files created are deleted.

	For example, the following is a comparison of stack limit from test_case3.joos:

	test_case3

	Stack Limit Values:

	-----------------------
	Group-h	|	A+
	-----------------------
	1 		|	1
	2 		|	2

	In this example we can see that the stack limits match.
