1. Which toolset you will use for the WIG project?

Sable-cc 3 will be used. 

2. What was frustrating about this milestone? Difficult? Time consuming? Boring? Easy? Interesting? Fun? You can include discussion of things such as using version control, group coordination, and environment setup.

Some parts of the flex+bison part of the assignment was boring. There were some times where the coding was just repetitive.

Figuring out how the sable-cc3 was a little bit harder than flex+bison, but once we understood
how it worked, everything went on quite smoothly.

We decided to use git-svn - setting that up and making it work properly took some time. 

Group coordination was perfect, we all had fun doing this assignment. 

3. What devious extension to the Tiny expressions should we ask students for next year?

You could ask them to implement partial evaluation fully.
