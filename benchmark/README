The benchmark is an implementation of Schelling's Segregation Model:
(http://web.mit.edu/rajsingh/www/lab/alife/schelling.html)

Schelling showed that a small preference for one's neighbours of thei
same color could lead to total segregation.
People within a certain tolerance stay in their current position. 
If their neighbours are intolerable or new neighbours come in that 
are intolerable they move. The simulation shows that this could lead
to a constant segregation where the community never settles or in some 
cases it settles. 

The input grid is loaded on to the file in. If the first parameter of the 
file is set to false, the program randomly generates the grid. Otherwise 
it reads the grid in. The first four integers after that represent the 
tolerancei level, grid size, _population and simulation wait respectively. 
If a large number of output is desired, simulation wait should be changed 
to 0. 

After the parameters are read, each int represents the character type in 
the grid which should be the ascii equivalent of '@', '*' or '.'. The 
ascii equivalent is loaded on to a 2D vector grid. The simulation code
itself is commented. There are two primary classes, a SimulationGrid 
which represents the data structure being manipulated and a ShellingSimulation
which runs the actual simulation itself.
